# A-Hybrid-Deep-Learning-VGG-16-Based-SVM-Model

**Note:** The full reports and assignment instructions are written in **Persian** (attached). An English version can be provided on request.  

## Overview  
This submission includes two separate deep learning projects:  

1. **Chest X-ray Classification**  
   Developed and compared different CNN-based approaches (a custom CNN, transfer learning with **VGG16** and **MobileNetV2**) for detecting Normal, Pneumonia, and COVID-19 cases from chest X-ray images.  

2. **Vehicle Classification**  
   Implemented and tested multiple models for multi-class vehicle recognition, including **AlexNet**, a custom CNN, and a **VGG16 feature extractor with a Linear SVM** classifier.  

## Results & Takeaways  
- For X-ray classification, transfer learning models (especially VGG16 and MobileNetV2) achieved the highest accuracy and most reliable performance.  
- For vehicle classification, VGG16 + Linear SVM and AlexNet performed better than the simple CNN, with VGG16+SVM offering an efficient balance between speed and accuracy.
